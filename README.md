# zoom-volume-button-muter

Unfortunately, not all headsets have a mute button. However, many have volume buttons, so why not use those to mute instead!

Hence, this application adds the ability to mute zoom by sending the keyboard shortcuts to the mute window for zoom for you any time you hit the volume buttons.

# Installation

Simply open with Visual Studio, build the solution, and then run the exe output in the `bin` folder.
